1. How Kv1.3 Converts from Open Conducting to Non-Conducting Inactive Conformation
The Kv1.3 channel transitions from an open-conducting state to a non-conducting inactive state (C-type inactivation) through structural rearrangements primarily in the selectivity filter. The key process involves the rupture of intra-subunit hydrogen bonds, specifically those that tether the selectivity filter to the pore helix. These changes result in the outward rotation of residues such as Tyr447 and Asp449, dilating the outer pore and disrupting potassium ion flow.

Visual Representation:
The open-conducting state allows hydrated K⁺ ions to flow through the channel.
The non-conducting state exhibits a widened selectivity filter with reduced K⁺ occupancy, especially at sites like S2.
2. Mechanism of Transition to C-Type Inactivation
The mechanism involves:

Stabilization in the Open State:
Hydrogen bonds involving residues like Trp436 and Asp449 stabilize the selectivity filter in the conducting state.
Potassium ions coordinate at binding sites S1–S4 in the selectivity filter.
Hydrogen Bond Rupture:
Key bonds break, untethering the selectivity filter from the pore helix.
Outward Movement of Residues:
Residues such as Tyr447 rotate outwards by ~90°, disrupting ion coordination.
Asp449 and neighboring residues stabilize in new positions, altering the geometry of the filter.
Ion Flow Cessation:
The loss of coordination at sites S1 and S2 halts potassium ion conduction.
3. Key Residues in Conformational Studies
The following residues are crucial:

Tyr447: Rotates outward during inactivation, contributing to the widened outer filter.
Asp449: Stabilizes the dilated filter conformation by forming new intra-subunit hydrogen bonds.
His451: Interacts with Tyr447 and Asp449, further stabilizing the non-conducting state.
Visual Representation:
Images from structural studies (e.g., cryo-EM) show the positional changes of these residues during the transition from conducting to non-conducting states.
4. Mutational Studies
Mutations have been conducted to study the role of key residues:

Asp449Asn: Accelerates inactivation by disrupting hydrogen bonding.
His451Val: Slows down inactivation, highlighting the residue’s role in stabilization.
Tyr447Ala: Affects the selectivity filter's flexibility and ion coordination.
Page Reference:
Refer to Page 6-8 of the document for detailed discussions on the mutational impacts on Kv1.3 function.
5. What is C-Type Inactive Conformation?
C-type inactivation is a slow, time-dependent inactivation of the Kv1.3 channel. It occurs when the selectivity filter transitions to a dilated conformation, characterized by:

A widened outer pore.
Reduced K⁺ occupancy, particularly at sites S1 and S2.
Stabilization of the filter through new hydrogen bonds involving residues like Tyr447, Asp449, and His451.
6. Structure of Kv1.3 in Non-Conducting Conformation
Cryo-EM studies of Kv1.3 in the non-conducting state reveal:

A dilated outer selectivity filter with fewer potassium ions.
The inner gate remains open, but the widened outer filter prevents ion permeation.
Tyr447 and Asp449 adopt new positions, stabilizing the non-conducting conformation.
Visual Representation:
Include cryo-EM density maps showing structural differences between the open and C-type inactivated states.
7. Selective Filter of Kv1.3
The selectivity filter consists of four binding sites (S1–S4) that coordinate potassium ions in the conducting state. Key features in the C-type inactivated state:

S1 and S2 sites lose potassium coordination due to reorientation of carbonyl groups.
The outer filter widens, disrupting ion flow.

what are the residues of selective filter
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The selectivity filter of the Kv1.3 channel consists of specific residues that are critical for coordinating potassium ions and ensuring selective permeability. These residues are highly conserved among potassium channels and line the narrow pore of the filter.

Key Residues of the Selectivity Filter:
The residues are located in the P-loop region of each subunit, forming the narrow, ion-selective portion of the channel. In Kv1.3, the residues that constitute the selectivity filter include:

Gly446: This residue contributes to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms that interact with K⁺ ions.
Tyr447: Plays a key role in coordinating K⁺ and rotates outward during C-type inactivation, contributing to the dilation of the outer pore.
Gly448: Another residue that contributes carbonyl groups for ion coordination.
Asp449: Stabilizes the selectivity filter in the inactivated state by forming hydrogen bonds.
Val450: Located adjacent to the selectivity filter, contributes to filter geometry and stability.
These residues are aligned in a precise orientation to form four potassium-binding sites (S1–S4) in the selectivity filter, which selectively allow K⁺ ions to pass while excluding other ions like Na⁺.

Binding Sites and Coordination:
The selectivity filter binds K⁺ ions in a dehydrated state at the binding sites S1, S2, S3, and S4.
The carbonyl oxygen atoms of these residues coordinate the ions, mimicking hydration and enabling selective permeability.
Role in C-Type Inactivation:
During C-type inactivation:

Tyr447 and Asp449 undergo conformational changes, leading to a widening of the outer filter.
This disruption reduces ion occupancy, particularly at sites S1 and S2, rendering the channel non-conducting.
Would you like to see visual representations or additional details on these residues?

How Kv1.3 channel is activated 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Activation of the Kv1.3 Channel
The Kv1.3 channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel, and its activation is driven by changes in the membrane potential. Activation involves conformational changes in both the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the pore domain (PD), leading to channel opening and potassium ion efflux.

Steps in Activation
Resting State:

At resting membrane potential, the channel is closed.
The voltage-sensing domain (VSD), composed of the S1–S4 helices, is stabilized in its resting conformation.
The inner gate, formed by the S6 helices, remains closed.
Membrane Depolarization:

Upon depolarization, the membrane potential becomes less negative.
Positively charged residues, such as Arg and Lys on the S4 helix (the voltage sensor), experience electrostatic forces and move outward within the membrane.
Conformational Changes in the VSD:

Outward movement of the S4 helix triggers a rearrangement of the voltage-sensing domain.
This movement is transmitted to the pore domain (S5 and S6 helices) through the S4-S5 linker.
Opening of the Inner Gate:

The S6 helices undergo a hinge-like movement, pulling apart the intracellular gate and opening the pore.
This allows potassium ions (K⁺) to flow through the channel, down their electrochemical gradient.
Selective Ion Permeation:

K⁺ ions enter the channel's central cavity, lose their hydration shell, and pass through the selectivity filter in single file.
The selectivity filter, formed by residues such as Gly446, Tyr447, Gly448, Asp449, and Val450, ensures selective permeability to K⁺ over other ions like Na⁺.
Structural Features Facilitating Activation
Voltage Sensor (S4 helix):
Contains positively charged residues that respond to changes in membrane potential.
S4-S5 Linker:
Couples the VSD's movement to the pore domain, transmitting the gating signal.
Inner Gate:
Formed by the S6 helices, which control access to the central cavity and selectivity filter.
Electrophysiological Characteristics
Activation occurs within milliseconds after depolarization.
Potassium efflux through Kv1.3 channels hyperpolarizes the membrane, regulating cellular excitability and calcium signaling in immune cells such as T lymphocytes.
Would you like detailed diagrams or molecular representations to accompany this explanation?

what is the importance of Tryptophan in pore region 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Importance of Tryptophan in the Pore Region of Kv1.3
Tryptophan residues in the pore region of potassium channels, including Kv1.3, play crucial roles in maintaining structural integrity, gating, and ion permeation. Specifically, Trp436 in the pore region of Kv1.3 is a key residue for channel function.

Roles of Tryptophan in the Pore Region
Stabilization of the Selectivity Filter:

Trp436 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp449, which help tether the selectivity filter to the pore helix in the open-conducting state.
This interaction is critical for maintaining the selectivity filter’s precise geometry, enabling selective K⁺ ion conduction.
Preventing Premature Inactivation:

The hydrogen bond between Trp436 and Asp449 prevents the untethered movement of the selectivity filter, thereby delaying C-type inactivation.
Mutations at this position can destabilize the filter and accelerate the transition to the non-conducting state.
Coupling Voltage-Sensing to Gating:

Trp residues in the pore region are positioned strategically to act as intermediaries, linking the movements of the voltage-sensing domain (S1-S4 helices) to conformational changes in the pore domain (S5-S6 helices).
Channel Conductance:

The structural integrity provided by Trp436 ensures that the ion conduction pathway remains open during the activated state.
It helps maintain the proper alignment of residues in the selectivity filter, facilitating the efficient flow of K⁺ ions.
Mutational Studies on Tryptophan
Trp436 Mutations:

Substitution of Trp436 with other residues (e.g., alanine or phenylalanine) disrupts hydrogen bonding and leads to loss of gating fidelity.
Such mutations often result in faster C-type inactivation or complete loss of channel functionality.
Comparative studies in related channels show that analogous tryptophan residues are equally critical for gating and selectivity, underscoring their evolutionary conservation and functional importance.

C-Type Inactivation
During C-type inactivation, the rupture of the Trp436–Asp449 hydrogen bond allows the selectivity filter to dilate. This movement disrupts K⁺ ion coordination and renders the channel non-conducting.
Summary
Tryptophan residues in the pore region, such as Trp436 in Kv1.3, are indispensable for:

Stabilizing the channel structure.
Regulating ion selectivity and conductance.
Modulating gating transitions, particularly C-type inactivation.
This makes Trp436 a key residue for channel function and a potential target for pharmacological modulation. Let me know if you'd like details on experimental evidence or specific structural diagrams!
